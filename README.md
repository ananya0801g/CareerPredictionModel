This project is a machine learning-based Career Prediction System designed to suggest suitable job roles for individuals based on their academic performance, interests, skills, and personal traits. Developed using Python, the system integrates various technologies such as Streamlit for the frontend interface, Scikit-learn for model training and prediction, Pandas and NumPy for data processing, and SQLite for storing user information. The prediction model is trained on a dataset containing features like coding skills, logical quotient rating, public speaking points, certifications, preferred books, and career interests. Categorical features are encoded using label encoding, binary encoding, and dummy variables to ensure the model handles diverse user input efficiently.

The main application is served through app.py using Streamlit, where users can enter their details and receive a predicted career option. Additionally, the app displays visual insights such as correlation heatmaps to help understand the relationship between skills and job roles. The user inputs are saved in an SQLite database (CBRSdata.db) using utility functions defined in db.py. The machine learning model, built using a Decision Tree Classifier, is stored in weights.pkl and trained with the script training.py. All required libraries are listed in the requirements.txt file for easy setup.

The application is easy to deploy and use. Users can clone the repository, install the required libraries, train the model using the training script, and launch the web interface using Streamlit. This tool can be beneficial for students, academic advisors, and professionals looking to explore potential career paths based on structured data and predictive analytics. The project was collaboratively developed by Ananya Goyal.
